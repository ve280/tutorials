**Notes**:

To speed up your downloading, you may change your source list to SJTU source by typing the command below.

```
sudo sed -i 's/archive.ubuntu.com/ftp.sjtu.edu.cn/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Then update the list of available packages before installing any of them.

```
sudo apt update
```

Now you can install packages from the SJTU source, for example, `build-essential`, which includes `gcc`, `g++`, `make`, etc.

```
sudo apt install build-essential
```
